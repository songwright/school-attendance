# School Attendance Table

This is an app that I made from my front end developer class with Udacity.com. It uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to show the attendance of students at a school. This was a lesson in refactoring spaghetti code. I used a nested loop to render the data in a table with interactive checkboxes.

From February 2019
